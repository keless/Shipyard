* implement scrolling panel view for parts list (page up/down, not pixel scroll)
* implement more ship parts
	-- new category: shields
	-- new category: cabin
* drag and drop editor 
	-- attach to ship logic: dont overlap? 
* support for multiple ships
	-- turn off destroyActiveOnBuild when this is true 
* flight mode 
	-- stars (or other background point of reference)
	-- add particlesystem for thrusters
* weapon system
  -- visual weapon states (missle no ammo, gauss charging, lazer/cannon firing)
	-- weapon groups, map keys->groups->weapons
	-- missiles: 
		> decouple 'projectile' from 'launcher'
		> implement fire rate cooldown 
		> damage target on hit
* implement a reason to fly;
  MISSION SYSTEM
  -- navigation tutorial, fly between waypoints
	-- shoot training targets
	-- ferry people between stations
	-- pick up cargo
	-- rescue a distressed ship
	FREE FLIGHT WORLD SIMULATION SYSTEM

* fix bugs:
  -- find bugs to fix
  -- hangar editor: when re-attaching frame, make CoM dot top-most

* possible gameplay fixes 
	-- question: should 'x/y' joystick be relative to ship (current) or relative to mouse heading?

WIP:
* design test
	-- test designs for 'capitol ship' 'large cargo ship' 'corvette' and 'fighter' types
		> add parts for different ship classes as neccesary
		> capitol ship:  huge, slow, much armor, many weapons (turrets? drone bays? shields?) ,wow
		> large cargo: large, slow, massive cargo capacity
		> corvette: avg capacity, multi role
		> fighter: small, no cargo, no shields, some weapons, very maneuverable
